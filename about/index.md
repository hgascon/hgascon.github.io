I am a currently a Ph.D. researcher at the Institute of System Security at TU
Braunschweig. Prior to this, I graduated in Telecommunication Engineering at
the Computer Security Lab at Carlos III University of Madrid and then joined
the Machine Learning Group of Prof. Dr. MÃ¼ller at the Berlin Institute of
Technology. 

During autumn 2015 I joined the Symantec Center
for Advanced Machine Learning in Mountain View as a research intern, where I
worked on deep learning methods for classifcation of code graph representations
to infer behavioral patterns in malicious code.<br><br>

My research interests revolve around the development of new learning methods
for high dimentional structured data to analyse and reverse engineer malware
code and build system behavioral models that facilitate
the early identification of targeted attacks (a.k.a. APTs)
