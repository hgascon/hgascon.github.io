I’m the Security Operations Lead at WIIT AG, where I design, deploy, and
continuously refine our security stack while overseeing day‑to‑day operations
and coordinating SOC analysts and engineers to ensure rapid detection,
response, and remediation.
<br>
<br>
In the past I have held several research and engineering roles across academia
and industry, working at the intersection of machine learning and computer
security. These days I’m especially excited about the real possibilities of
automation and generative AI to streamline security operations, building
faster, more accurate engines for threat analysis and detection.
