I am a Ph.D. researcher at the Computer Security Group of the University of
Göttingen. Prior to this, I have worked at the Machine Learning Group of Prof.
Dr. Müller at the Berlin Institute of Technology (TU Berlin) and at the
Computer Security Lab at Carlos III University of Madrid were I received a
M.Sc. in Telecommunication Engineering.<br><br>
My research interests focus on methods for high dimentional structured data and
machine learning applied to computer security. This currently includes
automatic learning of network protocols and analysis of malicious software and
its communication. My advisor is Prof. Dr. Konrad Rieck.
