I am currently a Security Engineer at WIIT AG, where I lead defense initiatives through planning and implementing our security stack, as well as providing oversight of security operations. In the past, I have held various positions in academia and industry, working at the intersection of machine learning and computer security.
<br><br>

I received my PhD from the Technical University of Braunschweig, where I
worked with Konrad Rieck at the Institute of System Security.  Previous to this,
and after graduating in Telecommunication Engineering at the Carlos III
University of Madrid, I was an associate researcher at the Machine Learning
Group of Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller at the Technical University of Berlin.
<br><br> 

My interests currently focus on applying machine learning, particularly generative AI, to enhance security operations through advanced threat analysis, the integration of threat intelligence, and the refinement of detection engines, ultimately streamlining security workflows.
