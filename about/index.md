I am Applied Researcher at German Edge Cloud and Associate Professor at the
ICAI School of Engineering in Madrid, where I teach the course on artificial
intelligence applied to computer security. 
<br><br>

I received my PhD from the Technical University of Braunschweig, where I
worked with Konrad Rieck at the Institute of System Security.  Previous to this,
and after graduating in Telecommunication Engineering at the Carlos III
University of Madrid, I was an associate researcher at the Machine Learning
Group of Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller at the Technical University of Berlin.
<br><br> 

My current interests revolve around private and secure AI, including privacy
preserving machine learning and security in distributed learning environments.
