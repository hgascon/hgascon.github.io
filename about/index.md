I am a currently a Ph.D. researcher at the Computer Security Group of the
University of Göttingen. Prior to this, I worked at the Machine Learning Group
of Prof. Dr. Müller at the Berlin Institute of Technology and at the Computer
Security Lab at Carlos III University of Madrid, where I received a M.Sc. in
Telecommunication Engineering. During autumn 2015 I joined the Symantec Center
for Advanced Machine Learning in Mountain View as a research intern, where I worked 
on deep learning methods to analyse and classify behavioral patterns in
malicious code.<br><br>

My research interests revolve around the development of new learning methods
for high dimentional structured data to analyse and reverse engineer malware
samples and build system behavioral models (software and human) that facilitate
the early identification of targeted attacks (a.k.a. APTs)
