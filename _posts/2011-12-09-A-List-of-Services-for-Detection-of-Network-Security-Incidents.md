A few days ago, the European Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) released an interesting report called Proactive Detection of Network Security Incidents. By means of extensive surveys among CERTs and further discussions, they have come with a pool of available methods, activities and information sources for detection and analysis of network security incidents. Many of this sources are already used or could be potentially used by national/governmental and other CERTs. Also by researchers craving for new data. As this kind of useful information tends to end buried in the to-read-someday folder, I thought it might be interesting to gather all sources and initiatives in a handy list.
