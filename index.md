I am data scientist at DCSO, the German Cyber Security Organization,
where our team drives innovation in threat detection and analysis through
applied research on machine learning for security.
<br><br>

I received my PhD from the Technical University of Braunschweig in 2019, where I
worked with Konrad Rieck at the Institute of System Security.  Previous to this,
and after graduating in Telecommunication Engineering at the Carlos III
University of Madrid, I was an associate researcher at the Machine Learning
Group of Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller at the Technical University of Berlin.
<br><br> 

In 2015 I joined the Symantec Center for Advanced Machine Learning in Mountain
View as a research intern, where I worked on deep learning methods for
classification of code graph representations to infer behavioral patterns in
malicious code.
<br><br>

Currently, I am interested in machine learning methods for high dimensional
structured data to analyse and reverse engineer malware code and build
behavioral models that enable the early identification of targeted attacks.
