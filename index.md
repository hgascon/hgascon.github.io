I am Senior Data Scientist at DCSO, the German Cybersecurity Organization, and
Associate Professor at the ICAI School of Engineering in Madrid, where I teach
the course on artificial intelligence applied to computer security.
<br><br>

I received my PhD from the Technical University of Braunschweig, where I
worked with Konrad Rieck at the Institute of System Security.  Previous to this,
and after graduating in Telecommunication Engineering at the Carlos III
University of Madrid, I was an associate researcher at the Machine Learning
Group of Klaus-Robert MÃ¼ller at the Technical University of Berlin.
<br><br> 

In 2015 I joined the Symantec Center for Advanced Machine Learning in Mountain
View as a research intern, where I worked on deep learning methods for
classification of code graph representations to infer behavioral patterns in
malicious code.
<br><br>

My current interests revolve around machine learning methods for high
dimensional structured data, with a focus on the early identification of
targeted attacks, as well as all practical aspects of bringing learning based
solutions for large scale security problems effectively into production.
