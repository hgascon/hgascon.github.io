Adagio is a collection of Python modules for analyzing and detecting Android malware. These modules allow to extract labeled call graphs from Android APKs or DEX files and apply an explicit feature map that captures their structural relationships. Additional modules provide classes for designing binary or multiclass classification experiments and applying machine learning for detection of malicious structure. Find the code at its GitHub [repository](https://github.com/hgascon/adagio).

The Honeynet Project Acapulco app bundles a Splunk application that can be deployed on a central server to automatically generate meta-events from several hpfeeds channels. This events are clustered using DBSCAN or K-means algorithms and displayed at an external client using parallel coordinates graphs based on the D3.js visualization library. The first release was supported by the Google Summer of Code 2012 program and mentored by The Honeynet Project. The code can be found at its GitHub [repository](https://github.com/hgascon/Acapulco4HNP).
